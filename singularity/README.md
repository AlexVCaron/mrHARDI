# Magic-monkey Singularity image

This directory contains the required files to build the singularity image 
containing the whole collection of applications and configurations of the 
project. It is a plus when using the nextflow library to have this image 
ready and available, since no setup is needed for the user.

## Requirements

- [Singularity 3](https://sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/installation.html)
- Python 3 for initial preparation of the project's wheel
- Diamond repository copied to an archive named **diamond_package.tar.gz** 
  (either contact *BenoÃ®t Scherrer* to request access to the official 
  repository or contact the administrator of this code base for a copy of the 
  singularity)

## Content of the image

- Mrtrix 3
- ANTs Registration
- FSL
- Diamond
- Python 3 with libraries
    - Scilpy
    - Magic-monkey
    - Dipy
    - Numpy / Scipy
    - Nibabel / Pynrrd
- Cuda 9.1

## Building the image

Singularity makes it easy to build the image in one line of code. Before 
calling the build sequence, ensure that your shell's current directory is 
the one containing this Readme. Then, call

> sudo singularity build <image_name>.<sif/simg> magic_monkey_singularity.def

The build process takes about half an hour on a conventional 3 cores processor.

## Using the packaged applications

All the applications listed above can be called directly on the singularity 
using

> singularity exec \<image> \<application>

For example to call the *dwidenoise* algorithm from Mrtrix, use

> singularity exec \<image> dwidenoise \<args>

To make your data available to the singularity, add the option *-B* before
**exec**, with a comma separated list of the paths to bind.

> singularity -B \<path 1>,\<path 2> exec ...

## Developers

Building and rebuilding a Singularity can be time consuming. For this purpose, 
the definition file has been crafted to allow for installation checkpoints.

This means that updating a *sandbox* image is possible. After creating a first 
version of the image using

> sudo singularity build --sandbox \<image> magic_monkey_singularity.def

subsequent versions of it can be updated with

> sudo singularity build --update \<image> magic_monkey_singularity.def

As of now, building the singularity will never lead to error, meaning you'll 
always end up with an image at the end, just maybe not filled with all the 
content that should be on it. This means that you should always check the 
build outputs and the executables on the final image.

A good indicator is the standard output of the build process. If anything 
happened, it will have at the end of it an error message that is quite hard 
to miss .
